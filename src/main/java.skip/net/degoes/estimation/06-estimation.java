/**
 * ESTIMATION
 *
 * Nothing can replace benchmarking and profiling. However, over time, you can gain an intuition
 * about how quickly or slowly code might execute compared to its theoretical optimum. This is
 * especially true both as you come to appreciate the different features that combine to reduce the
 * performance of code, as well as learn to notice where those different features are introduced
 * into your application through use of high-level language features and libraries.
 *
 * In this section, you will work on your skills of estimation as you work through a variety of
 * benchmarks. As you will see, your estimation, even if honed properly, does not always correspond
 * to the performance reality on the JVM.
 *
 * EXERCISE 1
 *
 * Study both benchmarks and estimate which one you believe will execute more quickly. Then run the
 * benchmark. If the results match your expectations, then try to explain why that might be the
 * case. If the results do not match your expectations, then hypothesize and test until you can come
 * up with an explanation for why.
 *
 * See estimation/Estimation1Benchmark.java
 *
 * EXERCISE 2
 *
 * Study both benchmarks and estimate which one you believe will execute more quickly. Then run the
 * benchmark. If the results match your expectations, then try to explain why that might be the
 * case. If the results do not match your expectations, then hypothesize and test until you can come
 * up with an explanation for why.

 *
 * EXERCISE 3
 *
 * Study both benchmarks and estimate which one you believe will execute more quickly. Then run the
 * benchmark. If the results match your expectations, then try to explain why that might be the
 * case. If the results do not match your expectations, then hypothesize and test until you can come
 * up with an explanation for why.

 *
 * EXERCISE 4
 *
 * Study both benchmarks and estimate which one you believe will execute more quickly. Then run the
 * benchmark. If the results match your expectations, then try to explain why that might be the
 * case. If the results do not match your expectations, then hypothesize and test until you can come
 * up with an explanation for why.
