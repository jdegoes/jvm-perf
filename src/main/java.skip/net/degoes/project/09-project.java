 * In this section, you will tie together everything you have learned in order to significantly
 * optimize the performance of JVM-based code.

 *
 * GRADUATION PROJECT
 *
 * Develop a version of `Dataset` that has a similar API, but which is at least 10x as fast. See how
 * far you can push it (can you get to 100x?).
 *
 * You may assume data is completely homogeneous and that no values are null. However, if ambitious,
 * you may solve the same problem under the assumption of undefined values and heterogeneous data.
