/**
 * COLLECTIONS
 *
 * Thanks to powerful abstractions on the JVM, including java.util Collections, or standard library
 * collections in Scala, Kotlin, and other JVM-based languages, it is easy to write code that
 * processes data in bulk.
 *
 * With this ease comes a danger: it is easy to write code that is not performant. This performance
 * cost comes about because of several factors:
 *
 *   1. Wrong collection type. Different collection types have different overhead on different kinds
 *      of operations. For example, doubly-linked linked lists are good at prepending and appending
 *      single elements, but are terrible at random access.
 *
 * 2. Boxing of primitives. On the JVM, primitives are not objects, and so they must be boxed into
 * objects in order to be stored in collections. This boxing and unboxing can be expensive.
 *
 * 3. Cache locality. Modern CPUs are very fast, but they are also very complex. One of the ways
 * that CPUs achieve their speed is by caching data in memory. Most collection types do not store
 * their elements contiguously in memory, even if they are primitives, and so cannot take advantage
 * of the CPU cache, resulting in slower performance.
 *
 * In this section, you will use the JMH benchmarking tool in order to explore collection
 * performance across a range of collections, and then you will discover not only how to use the
 * fastest collection type but how to increase its applicability to a wider range of use cases.

/**
 * EXERCISE 1
 *
 * This benchmark is currently configured with List, which is a Scala linked-list data type. Add two
 * other collection types to this benchmark (in Scala, choose Vector and Array; if completing these
 * exercises in another programming language, be sure to at least choose Array).
 *
 * EXERCISE 2
 *
 * Identify which collection is the fastest for prepending a single element, and explain why.
